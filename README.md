# WarGame
My own game made from scratch.

The game is made for API but a version of a 1v1 is gonna be able to in a later stage.

The works so you have to press a number and followed by enter. You start off with x DEF and you have to fight and/or protect your base!

Game is still in early stage and is NOT playable yet!
